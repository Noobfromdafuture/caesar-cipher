# Caesar Cipher (Python) 

This is a bsic implementation of the Caesar cipher, an encryption technique where each letter is shifted by a fixed number in the alphabet.
I did part of this project in the free course "Scientific Computing with Python" on Freecodecamp.org and added the interaction part later.

## How to use

Run the script and enter:
  - A message (letters only)
  - A shift value (positive integer)

```bash
$ python caesar.py
Enter the message to encrypt: Aí sim!
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3): 3

Encrypted message: Dí vlp!
